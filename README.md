# PyDictionary
This is my first python project.
Breifly this is a command line based Dictionary which will prompt the user to enter a word that they want to know the meaning of
and it returns the meaning of the word you enterd in place.
You can test it as bad as you can and help me fix the bugs just by letting me know what you did and what has happend.
If you found any improvements you are welcome to make them as well.
This MyDictionary.py file contains all the code,just clone or download it and run on any command line right away.
It is well documented, i have carefully taken the steps to make every beginner to understand every single line to get started.
